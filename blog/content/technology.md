Not too long ago the literature of organizations consisted largely of mirrors for princess and principles of organizations; these were didactic statements which hold on certain situations and aspects of control and behavior, but in a broader sense, the term is also used to cover histories or work aimed at creating patterns for imitation or avoidance.

Today this is no longer the case; knowledge of organizations is incomplete, and perhaps the best we can do at preset is to use it to guide our inquiries about answers rather than as a precise tool to develop them.

On the surface, this shift from positive statements to qualified less precise ones might seem to be a regression, a loss of position.

Actually, it amounts to an enormous step forward. The simple faith in the existence of a final and ultimate answer has been replaced by a more mature and sophisticate understanding of the concurrent factors involved in organizations.

## Our work process
We use the ZeroMQ C4 process working on nonsense.ws, which means that every change is tracked as an issue.

Your can define an issue for a problem and then propose your own patch, or wait for someone else to fix it... you can also come immediately with a patch, and submit that as a pull request, without a separate issue.

An ideal description for an issue goes:

- Problem: (describe the problem here)
- Solution: (describe your solution here)

Please do not create issues for ideas or feature requests.

Come with clear problems and pausible solutions.

## Join the community
All things live on Microsoft GitHub at @nonsensews.

We are an open-source community with a clear focus.

Every project owner runs their ship as they see fit, our members jump from ship to ship over time.
