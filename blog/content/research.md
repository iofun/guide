Nonsense is a cluster operating system full of high-availability tools that runs on a wide variety of platforms.

The system run hosted as a user space application on any existing linux distribution and it's also available pre-installed on top of a custom [Debian](https://debian.org) stable live image.

Each node presents an identical environment to your working space, irrespective of the underlying host our focus allow you to spawn clean egalitarian homogeneous grids across multiple clusters of heterogeneous peers.

A communications protocol called [ZMTP](http://zmtp.org) version 3.1 is applied uniformly to access both local and remote resources with official support for processes in [Erlang](http://www.erlang.org/), [Python](https://www.python.org/), [Lua](https://lua.org) and community support for zillion others via standard ZeroMQ libraries we all communicate like you and me by passing messages around.

### Code and documentation

The Code lives at the expected GitHub [organization](https://github.com/nonsensews) at [nonsensews](https://github.com/nonsensews).

The Computer Nonsense [Guide](https://github.com/nonsensews/guide/wiki) explains our environment and the [community website](https://nonsense.ws) links to our work process, read the rules and join the team!

## The goal function

Determine the relative success or failure of the organization.

If it wins at StarCraft: Brood War, with a system that extract value from information models design for online competition, it's a #kicass success; if not, it is to that degree unsuccessful.

Goals function as starting point analysis leading to a hierarchy of objectives and to a definition of shata, units and nodes.

## Undecidable decisions

Information models are used in two ways; one are schemes with central focus goals, deterministic objectives.

The other schemata is the result of system models that focus on organization general properties and processes.

## The system approach

This approach does not give prime attention to organizational objectives but to those attributes relevant to any goal.

The systems model consider the organization as receiving inputs from the environmet and delivering outputs to it.
