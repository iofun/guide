We are all about open-source research in artificial intelligence, distributed systems and high-performance computing.

**Our Mission**: provide tools inside a simple unix-like workspace building information models through observation and action.

**Our Goal**: a distributed AI toolkit and workspace environment for machines of all ages!

We make a stable workspace that anyone can use today, at nonsense these things work together into one unified environment with native support for Python 3, LuaLang and the BEAM ecosystem.

## Before start
Check your system have the latest Erlang, LuaJIT (with luarocks) and Singularity installed.

## Installation
Then run this command:

``luarocks install pkg``

For help using pkg, including a list of commands, run:

``$ pkg --help``

Congratulations, you are jacked up and good to go!

## Community
Team up with artists and scientists that spawn network resources where you discover new information models.

The laboratory conducts multidisciplinary research in distributed systems, artificial intelligence and high-performance computing.

To achieve our goal we focus on general-purpose strategies that networks learn from experience on different environments.

We combine machine learning research in a virtual space for public open-source resources, private services and business.

## When is done
We have no roadmaps, no feature requests, no regular meetings, no central planning committees.

We make a promise: don't break your working space.

You'll find all types of network services talking to each other inside multiple regions of the cloud multiverse.
