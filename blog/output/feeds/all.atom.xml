&lt;p&gt;Today this is no longer the case; knowledge of organizations is incomplete, and perhaps the best we can do at preset is to use it to guide our inquiries about answers rather than as a precise tool to develop them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the surface, this shift from positive statements to qualified less precise ones might seem to be a regression, a loss of position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, it amounts to an enormous step forward. The simple faith in the existence of a final and ultimate answer has been replaced by a more mature and sophisticate understanding of the concurrent factors involved in organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="our-work-process"&gt;Our work process&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We use the ZeroMQ C4 process working on nonsense.ws, which means that every change is tracked as an issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your can define an issue for a problem and then propose your own patch, or wait for someone else to fix it... you can also come immediately with a patch, and submit that as a pull request, without a separate issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An ideal description for an issue goes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Problem: (describe the problem here)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Solution: (describe your solution here)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please do not create issues for ideas or feature requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come with clear problems and pausible solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="join-the-community"&gt;Join the community&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All things live on Microsoft GitHub at @nonsensews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are an open-source community with a clear focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every project owner runs their ship as they see fit, our members jump from ship to ship over time.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Open Research Community</title><link href="https://blog.nonsense.ws/open-research-community.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-07-11T14:20:00+00:00</published><updated>2018-07-11T14:20:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Team Machine</name></author><id>tag:blog.nonsense.ws,2018-07-11:/open-research-community.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Nonsense is a cluster operating system full of high-availability tools that runs on a wide variety of platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each node presents an identical environment to your working space, irrespective of the underlying host our focus allow you to spawn clean egalitarian homogeneous grids across multiple clusters of heterogeneous peers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A communications protocol called &lt;a href="http://zmtp.org"&gt;ZMTP&lt;/a&gt; version 3.1 is applied uniformly to access both local and remote resources with official support for processes in &lt;a href="http://www.erlang.org/"&gt;Erlang&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.python.org/"&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://lua.org"&gt;Lua&lt;/a&gt; and community support for zillion others via standard ZeroMQ libraries we all communicate like you and me by passing messages around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="code-and-documentation"&gt;Code and documentation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Code lives at the expected GitHub &lt;a href="https://github.com/nonsensews"&gt;organization&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="https://github.com/nonsensews"&gt;nonsensews&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-goal-function_1"&gt;The goal function&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Determine the relative success or failure of the organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it wins at StarCraft: Brood War, with a system that extract value from information models design for online competition, it's a #kicass success; if not, it is to that degree unsuccessful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goals function as starting point analysis leading to a hierarchy of objectives and to a definition of shata, units and nodes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="undecidable-decisions"&gt;Undecidable decisions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Information models are used in two ways; one are schemes with central focus goals, deterministic objectives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other schemata is the result of system models that focus on organization general properties and processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-system-approach"&gt;The system approach&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This approach does not give prime attention to organizational objectives but to those attributes relevant to any goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The systems model consider the organization as receiving inputs from the environmet and delivering outputs to it.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Distributed Artificial Intelligence</title><link href="https://blog.nonsense.ws/distributed-artificial-intelligence.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-07-11T04:20:00+00:00</published><updated>2018-07-11T04:20:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Team Machine</name></author><id>tag:blog.nonsense.ws,2018-07-11:/distributed-artificial-intelligence.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;We are all about open-source research in artificial intelligence, distributed systems and high-performance computing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our Goal&lt;/strong&gt;: a distributed AI toolkit and workspace environment for machines of all ages!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We make a stable workspace that anyone can use today, at nonsense these things work together into one unified environment with native support for Python 3, LuaLang and the BEAM ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="before-start"&gt;Before start&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check your system have the latest Erlang, LuaJIT (with luarocks) and Singularity installed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="installation"&gt;Installation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then run this command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;luarocks install pkg&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For help using pkg, including a list of commands, run:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ pkg --help&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congratulations, you are jacked up and good to go!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="community"&gt;Community&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Team up with artists and scientists that spawn network resources where you discover new information models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The laboratory conducts multidisciplinary research in distributed systems, artificial intelligence and high-performance computing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To achieve our goal we focus on general-purpose strategies that networks learn from experience on different environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We combine machine learning research in a virtual space for public open-source resources, private services and business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="when-is-done"&gt;When is done&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have no roadmaps, no feature requests, no regular meetings, no central planning committees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We make a promise: don't break your working space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll find all types of network services talking to each other inside multiple regions of the cloud multiverse.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry></feed>
